    <h1>Privacy Policy for FIREcalc</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 14, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to FIREcalc! This Privacy Policy explains how FIREcalc ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the FIREcalc application (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect (and What We Don't)</h2>
    <p>FIREcalc is designed with your privacy in mind.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Calculator Input Data:</strong> When you use the Savings Simulator or Retirement Simulator, you provide financial information such as your age, current savings, income, expenses, retirement goals, and investment strategies ("Calculator Data"). <strong>This Calculator Data is processed locally within the App on your device or in your browser session. We do not store, transmit, or have access to this Calculator Data on our servers.</strong> It is used solely to perform the simulations you request and display the results to you.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Analysis Feature:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If you choose to use the "AI Analysis" feature, the financial scenario data (your inputs for the active calculator and its simulation results) will be sent to a third-party AI service provider (OpenAI) through a secure proxy managed by us.</li>
                <li><strong>We do not require or knowingly send any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) like your name, email, or specific account details with this request.</strong> The data sent is limited to the financial parameters and results needed to generate the analysis.</li>
                <li>The AI service provider (OpenAI) processes this data according to its own privacy policy to generate the financial insights displayed back to you in the App.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Accounts:</strong> FIREcalc does not require you to create a user account or provide personal information like your name or email address to use its core calculator functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data (Standard Web Logs):</strong> Like most websites and online services, our hosting provider (e.g., Cloudflare) may collect standard technical information when you access the App online (e.g., via <code>firecalc.ai</code>). This may include IP addresses, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and pages visited. This information is typically aggregated and used for statistical purposes, to maintain service security, and to improve the App. This data is subject to the privacy policy of our hosting provider and is not directly linked by us to your specific Calculator Data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide App Functionality:</strong> Your Calculator Data is used locally on your device to perform the financial simulations and display the results and charts you request within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> If you opt-in to use the AI Analysis feature, your anonymized financial scenario data is used by OpenAI to generate personalized financial insights and advice, which is then displayed to you within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized usage data (if any, from standard web logs) may be used to understand how users interact with the App, to monitor performance, and to guide improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Calculator Data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Analysis Feature:</strong> When you use the AI Analysis feature, the relevant (anonymized) financial scenario data is shared with OpenAI via our secure proxy for the sole purpose of providing you with the requested analysis. We do not share your PII with OpenAI through this feature. OpenAI's use of this data is governed by their privacy policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party service providers for hosting (e.g., Cloudflare). These providers have their own privacy policies governing their collection and use of data (like web server logs).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the App, or protect against legal liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Calculator Data:</strong> As Calculator Data is processed locally on your device and not stored on our servers, its security is primarily dependent on the security of your own device and browser environment.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Analysis Data:</strong> Data transmitted for the AI Analysis feature is sent via HTTPS to our secure proxy and then to OpenAI.</li>
        <li>We take reasonable steps to protect any information we handle, but no security system is impenetrable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> The AI Analysis feature utilizes OpenAI. You can review OpenAI's policies on their website.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> The FIREcalc website and PWA are hosted using services that may include Cloudflare. You can review Cloudflare's privacy policy on their website.</li>
        <li>The App may contain links to other websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites or services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>
